 # IDEAS:
 ## Space mercenary
 ### Colors:
Space mercenary - warpaint based on 1960s Sci Fi space posters.  
Often nowadays posters of that nature are depicted with toned down ${\color{#ff9a40}Orange}$, ${\color{#fafb60}Light Yellow}$, ${\color{#ff8060}Red}$  and ${\color{#6090ff}Blue}$ colors. This part is extremmely well for tf2 artstyle. Other colors are a slightly ${\color{#ffffc8}Yellowish white}$. As dark colors I think slightly lighter black night starry sky may work. It was usually depicted on printed copies in cmyk ink so it rarely was dark or pitch black. Usually it was more of ![](https://placehold.co/100x14/100000/fff?text=reddish+black), ![](https://placehold.co/100x14/101010/fff?text=lighter+black), ![](https://placehold.co/100x14/1b002b/fff?text=purplish+black) or even ![](https://placehold.co/100x14/000020/fff?text=dark+blue).
### Patterns
As for patterns night starry sky with occasional falling star may work as less patterned almost solid color dropback.  
Main pattern it is musch harder to think of something that will not look like color vomit and be eye grabbing too much. Maybe some "martian" hillside pattern with simpltistic patter of triangle mountains layered on top of another (kinda like paralax)
